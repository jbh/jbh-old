                      Who doesn't love bread? There will be a Git repository
                      hosted on Github that holds a curated list of favorite
                      breads. We will be cloning this Git repository onto an IBM
                      i, and I, the speaker, will be coaching everyone through
                      the steps of contributing their favorite breads. If
                      multiple people have the same favorite bread, we will be
                      refactoring and solving merge conflicts. All contributions
                      will be done through a standard Git Workflow with branches
                      and pull requests. Lots to learn while having lots of fun!
                      You will need a Github account for this workshop. Please
                      have a Github account registered before attending the
                      workshop.

                          Ever wanted a butler? Me too. Alas, we can't all be
                          that posh. We can, however, enlist Jenkins to be our
                          software butler. Jenkins is an open source automation
                          server. It provides the tools necessary for continuous
                          integration and continuous delivery. By the end of
                          this talk, you should know how to install Jenkins on
                          IBM i as well as the basics of setting up your first
                          automation.

                          Software stuff everyone keeps screaming about. But
                          where do you begin? How does one install Yum on their

                          darn thing. Maybe you’ve been an IBM i system
                          administrator since the beginning, and you’re ready to
                          see what all the hype about BASH is. You could be an
                          RPG developer that wants to branch out and add another

                          a UNIX like environment on the IBM i, and this session
